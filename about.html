    <p class="p-about"> Have you ever come home from work to find your neighborhood filled with cars and visitors for a local market, fair, park event, or giveaway that you didn't even know about and missed? Or made weekend plans to travel only to find out that there was a free family event in your town you missed?  BlockClub Calendar is an easy to use app that lets community members or organizations post information for upcoming neighborhood events. By using geolocation, the app lets users sign up for notifications of upcoming events happening in your area, ensuring that you never unintentionally miss a local gathering or event again!</p>
